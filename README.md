# What is this "DAW"?

**DAW** is the working title of this non-standard "Digital Audio Workstation". The intention is to make it simpler and more ergonomic to use - focus is on playability and fun.

# Prototypes

[sample-record](./prototypes/sample-record/) records audio into ogg files.


# Future Features

## Sample recorder

Record audio samples quickly, with automatic trimming of leading silence, and autimatic triggering (through MIDI) of the sampled instrument.

## Sample player

If samples are recorded we need a way to play them back, using the computer keyboard or a MIDI device.

## MIDI Looper

A simple MIDI looper, which can record incoming MIDI and loop it to an external unit or the internal sample player.

## Synthesizer

No tiny knobs to twist, but instead keys to hold and a mouse to drag. Hold "A" and drag the mouse up to increase the envelope "Attack" time.

## Tracks

Tracks which are always recording and don't differentiate between MIDI & Audio, and a setup which makes recording many takes of multiple inputs simple.
